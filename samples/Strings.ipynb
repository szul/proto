    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is going to show the supplemental string methods of the `Proto` library, and what you can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some of these methods are now native, so you can use the native string methods instead, but since this library does not change the `prototype` you can use these duplicate methods with the `Proto` object prior to converting back to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, `Proto` was a part of the `Metron` front-end framework, which had a number of convenience helpers for JavaScript objects. Back then, `Metron` directly manipulated the `prototype` of the data type object, adding methods directly to those objects. When these convenience methods were abstracted to the `Proto` library, the methods were moved to their own object in order to avoid `prototype` manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `Proto`, first install the package with `npm install @strangelooprun/proto --save`. Then import the methods that create the wrappers for the data type objects. In this demo, we are talking about strings, so we'll import `s()`:"
